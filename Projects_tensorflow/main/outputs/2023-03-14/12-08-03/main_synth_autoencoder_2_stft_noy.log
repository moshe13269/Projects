[2023-03-14 12:08:12,777][tensorflow][WARNING] - AutoGraph could not transform <bound method GroupNormalization.call of <tensorflow_addons.layers.normalizations.GroupNormalization object at 0x7faee0516c70>> and will run it as-is.
Please report this to the TensorFlow team. When filing the bug, set the verbosity to 10 (on Linux, `export AUTOGRAPH_VERBOSITY=10`) and attach the full output.
Cause: module 'gast' has no attribute 'Index'
To silence this warning, decorate the function with @tf.autograph.experimental.do_not_convert
